# Installation and First Steps{#intro -}

## Getting R{-}

If you have never used or heard of `R` before, 
I suggest you start by reading about [data science in `R`](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [installing RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).
Only once you have done that can we continue.

## Installing rethomics packages{-}

As of today (`r Sys.Date()`), `rethomics` packages are not on CRAN, the official `R` package archive, yet.
Therefore, we will install their developmental version.

As a prerequisite, we need to install (once) `devtools` and load it:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

Ensure you have *no error messages*. `devtool` is a package that simplifies installation of unofficial packages (for instance hosted on github) like `rethomics` ones.
Then, we can install some of the `rethomics` packages easily.
For instance, let us install `behavr`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install_github("rethomics/behavr")
```

In the same way, you could install other `rethomics` packages by changing `"behavr"` for another package name. 
For instance, you could install `ggetho` with `install_github("rethomics/ggetho")`.

## List of `rethomics` packages{-}

Below is a list of all the `rethomics` packages as well as their individual PDF documentation, description and build status.


```{r kable, echo=FALSE}
packages <- c("behavr", 
              "ggetho",
              "damr",
              "scopr",
              "sleepr",
              "zeitgebr"
              )
titles <- sapply(packages, 
       function(p){
          if(!p %in% rownames(installed.packages()))
            return("Unavailable")
          packageDescription(p, fields="Title")
          }
  )

package_name <- sprintf("[%s](https://github.com/rethomics/%s)", packages, packages)
doc <- sprintf("[![PDF](assets/pdf_icon.png)](https://github.com/rethomics/%s/raw/master/%s.pdf)", packages, packages)
travis_ci <- sprintf("[![%s Travis-CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/rethomics/%s.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rethomics/%s)", packages,packages,packages)

coverage <- sprintf("[![%s Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/rethomics/%s/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/%s/behavr?branch=master)", packages, packages, packages)

# `scopr` [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rethomics/scopr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rethomics/scopr)[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/rethomics/scopr/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/scopr/behavr?branch=master)

library(knitr)
kable(data.frame(
              Package = package_name,
              Doc = doc, 
              Description = titles,
              Travis.CI = travis_ci,
              Coverage = coverage),
      row.names = FALSE)
