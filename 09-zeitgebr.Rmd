# Circadian rhythm analysis {#zeitgebr -}

<!-- **TODO the perfect one liner** -->

<!-- --------------------------- -->

<!-- ![TODO add some figure]("rethomics_files/figure-html/achitecture-1.png") -->

## Aims {-}
In this practical chapter, we will use a real experiment to learn how to:

* Use `zeitgebr` to compute periodograms
* Use [ggetho](ggetho.html) to draw double plotted actograms
* Average periodograms vs conditions
* Find and compare peaks 

## Prerequisites {-}
* You have read about [behavr tables](behavr.html)
* You are familiar with  [ggetho](ggetho.html), our visualisation tool
* You have already read the [damr tutorial](damr.html)
* Ensure you have [installed](intro.html#installing-rethomics-packages)
`behavr`, `damr`, `ggetho` and `zeitgebr` packages


## Background{-}

This tutorial focuses on circadian rhythm in *Drosophila*, but can be adapted easily to investigate periodicity in different contexts.
In it, we will use a DAM dataset that is provided (and preloaded) within the `damr` package.

## Getting the data {-}

Getting the data a lot simpler than in the other tutorials as it is already on your computer:

```{r}
library(damr)
library(zeitgebr)
library(ggetho)

# We load the data
data(dams_sample) 
# We copy the data to our own variable so we can alter it
dt <- copy(dams_sample) 
```
This data set is recording of 32 animals, in DD.
Let us print the metadata to understand the experiment a little bit:

```{r}
summary(dt)
print(dt[meta=T])
```

We can confirm we have 32 individuals. 
They are described by one of three "period groups" (e.g. a genotype or treatment). 
This is encoded int `period_group` metavariable can be either a "short"", "long"" or wild-type ("wt") period.

## Quality control {-}
This data is fairely clean already, so we will not do much.
For most purposes, you can apply the same principles as [data curation for sleep analysis](sleepr.html#data-curation).

### Regime changes {-}

In general (but not here), you will have a period of `LD` **"baseline"** preceding a change to a `DD` regime.
I suggest to encode that in the following way:

1. Manually add a column `baseline_days` in your metadata that defines the **number of days of baseline**.
2. **Sustract the number of baseline days** to all time points: `dt[, t := t - days(xmv(baseline_days))]`

As a result, `t = 0` now means "ZT0 of the transition day".
This makes a lot of sense as any baseline point is at a negative time (`t < 0`), whilst `t > 0` is for `DD`.
The nice thing is that you can work with data (e.g. replicates) that have different baseline duration as now **all time points are relative to the regime change**.

### Data enrichment {-}

By defaut, DAM data only has variables `t` and `activity`. The latter being the number of beam crosses over a time bin (e.g. one minute). We could define a variable `moving` that is `TRUE` when and only when `activity > 0`, and `FALSE` otherwise:

```{r}
dt[, moving := activity > 0]
```


### Overview plots {-}

The first representation we show could be activity all animals over time in the same page.
This would help to spot ourliers.
We simply do that with our **tile plot**.
Note how we have changed the LD colours to grey and black, grey being for subjective days (remember, we are in DD).

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height=12}
ggetho(dt, aes(z=activity)) +
      stat_ld_annotations(ld_colours = c("grey", "black"))+
      stat_tile_etho() 
```

Note that you can substitute other variables you have in `dt` (e.g. `moving`) for `activity`.


We see that two animals (region 5 and 10) seem to have died/escaped before the end of the experiment.
There is no right thing to do regarding dead animals. You could keep the data before death, or remove them altogether.
**It is eventually your responsibility to decide what to do with dead animals**. 
Here, I simply remove data after death:

```{r}
library(sleepr)
dt_curated <- curate_dead_animals(dt)
summary(dt_curated)
ggetho(dt_curated, aes(z=activity)) +
      stat_ld_annotations(ld_colours = c("grey", "black"))+
      stat_tile_etho() 

```

Our curated data is now stored in `dt_curated`.

## Double plotted actograms {-}

At the moment, the `id` is a very long string (e.g. `"2017-01-16 08:00:00|dams_sample.txt|01"`). It has the advantage to be unambiguous, but it is difficult to plot.
To help plotting, we can make a new variable that is simply **a different number for each individual**. Lets call it `uid`:

```{r}
dt_curated[, uid := 1 : .N, meta=T]
# We can map uid to id
dt_curated[, .(id, uid) ,meta=T]
```
As you see, we do keep `id` as a reference but `uid` for convenience in graphs.

To make a double plotted actogram, we use `ggetho`.
Read more about that in the [visualisation tutorial](ggetho.html#double-plotted-actograms).
Briefly, we set `multiplot` to `2` (`3` would be a triple plotted) one.
The variable of interest is on the `z` axis.
Note that instead of `moving`, you could plot raw `activity`.
Then, we use bar height to show the amount of movement (we could use `stat_tile_etho` which shows the variable of interest as colour a pixel intensity). 
Lastly, we split the graph by `uid`, so that each facet is a single animal.

```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height=6}
ggetho(dt_curated, aes(z = moving), multiplot = 2) + 
    stat_bar_tile_etho() +
    facet_wrap( ~ uid, ncol = 8)
```

Interestingly, you can use formula in facet to show or sort with other metavariables:

```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height=6}
ggetho(dt_curated, aes(z=moving), multiplot = 2) + 
    stat_bar_tile_etho() +
    facet_wrap( ~ period_group + uid, ncol=8, labeller = label_wrap_gen(multi_line=FALSE))
```
Now, we know which genotype match each `uid`. 
In your own work, you could generalise this concept to display more metavariables.
For instance, if you had a `sex` metavariable you could do: `facet_wrap( ~ period_group + sex + uid, ...)`.



## Periodograms {-}

### Computation {-}

An important part of circadian research is to compute the periodicity of the free running clock of multiple individuals.
Mathematically, we would like to build a preiodogram. That is, generally speaking, a representation of the density (i.e. **power**) of a signal at different **periods** (or frequencies).
In addition, a periodogram associates to each pair of power-period a **significance level**.
There are many algorithms to compute periodograms.
In `zeitgebr`, we have si far implemented:

* `ac_periodogram` -- An *autocorrelation* based method
* `ls_periodogram` -- *Lomb-Scargle* algorithm
* `chi_sq_periodogram` -- A *$\chi{}^2$* based one

See `?periodogram_methods` for references.

In order to compute periodograms, we use the `periodogram()` function.
We need to define which variable we want to study (e.g. `moving` or `activity`).
Then, we provide our data.
The methods described above can be passed as an argument.

For instance, if we want to analyse, with the $\chi{}^2$ method, activity:

```{r}
per_xsq_dt <- periodogram(activity, 
                        dt_curated,
                        FUN = chi_sq_periodogram)
per_xsq_dt
```
The result is another `behavr` table, with the same metadata. 
The data however, is now a list of power vs period (and significance).

Have a look at the other options (see `?periodogram`).

### Peaks finding {-}

Often, we want to know which are the peak periods in a periodogram.
This can be achieved thanks to the `find_peaks` function.
By default, it find a maximum of three peaks, which are sorted by their power (relative to the significance thershold).
Peaks that are not signifant are not accounted for (see the `alpha` argument).

```{r}
per_xsq_dt <- find_peaks(per_xsq_dt)
per_xsq_dt
```

This function annotates our data by adding a column named `"peak"`.
Whenever the row corresponds to a peak, it puts a number and `NA` otherwise.
The number is the rank of the peak (`1` being the first/tallest one).

### Visualisation{-}

In `ggetho`, the function `ggperio()` is designed specifically for displaying periodograms.
One could plot all the periodograms like so:

```{r}
ggperio(per_xsq_dt) + geom_line(aes(group = id, colour=period_group))
```

But it is very hard to read, so we will **facet per `uid`**.
In addition, we can use a special geometry (`geom_peak`) to show the values of the peak.
We draw a signifiance line as well, just using the `signif_threshold` variable:

```{r, fig.width = 12, fig.height=6}
ggperio(per_xsq_dt) + 
  geom_line(aes(group = id, colour = period_group)) +
  geom_peak(col = "black") +
  geom_line(aes(y = signif_threshold)) +
  facet_wrap(~ uid, ncol = 8)
```


Instead of drawing only the first peak, you could draw, for instance,  the first and second (`geom_peak(peak_rank = 1:2)`) or, only the second (`geom_peak(peak_rank = 2)`).

An interesting thing to do is a population average periodogram.
In this graph, the solid lines are the average power per group, whilst the shaded areas are Â± standard error:

```{r}
ggperio(per_xsq_dt, aes(
                  y = power - signif_threshold,
                  colour=period_group)) + 
                  stat_pop_etho()
```

### Exctract the peak values {-}

At some point, you would like to **summarise** each animal by, say, it first peak.
Then, you can look at whether there are significant difference in peak periodicity vs genotype.
Doing that is quite straigtforward.
First, we **select only rows where peak is exactly 1**, then [rejoin](https://rethomics.github.io/behavr.html#operating-on-behavr-tables) our table to its metadata:

```{r}
summary_dt <- rejoin(per_xsq_dt[peak==1])
summary_dt
```


`summary_dt` can be used as a standard `R` dataframe for further analysis.
For instance, with `ggplot`, I make a **boxplot showing the distribution of periods**, in h,  for each groups.
I also add **a point for each animal** (so we see outliers). 
Then, I make the **size of the points proportional to the relative power of the peak discovered**, so we get an idea of how much to "trust" this point.

```{r}
ggplot(summary_dt, aes(period_group, period, fill= period_group)) + 
        geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = NA) +
        geom_jitter(aes(size=power -  signif_threshold), alpha=.5) +
        scale_y_hours(name = "Period (h)") 
```

Another direction could be to perform pairwise wilcoxon tests between groups:

```{r}
pairwise.wilcox.test(summary_dt$period, summary_dt$period_group )
```

This tells us that their is a statistically significant difference between each pair of group.
